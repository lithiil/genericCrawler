# genericCrawler
This is a very simple abstract crawler that will download whatever items from an url.

I use this when I want to download lots of images, songs, pdfs, etc...
|To do this, use a selector that points to the link of the items ex: **'.generic_class li a'**

If you set the 3rd argument of the method, each link will be downloaded automatically in a folder named items + timestamp.
